# Variable and Mutability

In Remi we have 2 way to create a variable that store our value, these 2 way are what kind of allowed operation can be performed it can be a constant or not. When variable is a constant or immutable it cannot change value and for mutable value it can be change as the developer want to.

For example in Remi mutable variable will look like this :

```remi
vow my_number = 69;
```

For example in Remi immutable variable will look like this : 

```remi
eternal name = "Remi";
```
