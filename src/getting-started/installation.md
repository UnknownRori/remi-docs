# Installation

The first step to install Remi is to install Rust, FASM, and GCC, these three tools are necessarily to use Remi programming languages.

- Rust - used to install the Remi compiler
- FASM - used to generate object file (.o) from assembly generated by Remi compiler
- GCC  - used to link the final executable from object file


## Installing Rust

The first step to install Remi is to download a Rust programming language through `rustup`, it's command line tool that help managing Rust version and associated tools.

For more information you can go to it's website: https://rustup.rs/

### Installing rustup on Linux and MacOS

If you’re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```sh
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
``` 

Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their distribution’s documentation.

### Installing rustup on Windows

On Windows, go to [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll be prompted to install Visual Studio. This provides a linker and the native libraries needed to compile programs. If you need more help with this step, see [https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html)

## Installing FASM

To install FASM first you need to go to [https://flatassembler.net/](https://flatassembler.net/) and download FASM version 1.73.32 that correspond with your operating system and do not pick version 2 as it's not been tested, extract it and put it on the system path.

Now go give the FASM github repository a star : [https://github.com/tgrysztar/fasm](https://github.com/tgrysztar/fasm)

## Installing GCC

> If you are on Linux you can skip this part as you probably should already have it when installing the Rust

## Installing Remi

To install Remi you can directly install it from the main repository by using following command : 

```sh
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/UnknownRori/remi-lang/
```
